# Program Library

_This is your personal copy of the programs from the
module's *Program Library*._

_It is not marked. You can do what you want with this
programs, and a prize of one smug is offered if you 
find and report any errors._

_Should you need to fresh copy, you can download all the
programs from https://github.com/TonyJenkins/lbu-python-examples . You are
strongly advised not to `clone` this repo here, as having a repo inside
a repo is all sorts of confusing._

_Note: See `requirements.txt` for the dependencies needed by
some of the longer programs._
